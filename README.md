Hey! My name is (An)drew, im from Ohio. I work for a home remodeling company. I am a Senior in High School, some things about me are that I love the ocean and the weather. I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence and the blockchain. 


I am currently working on rockets to study and collect data on tornadoes and tropical weather.
