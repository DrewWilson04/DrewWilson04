Hey! My name is (An)drew, I'm from Ohio. 
I am the CMO and Social Media Manager for [EAL Arcade](https://ealarcade.com). 

In my free time I am working on launching weather data collection rockets, to better predict weather, and understand it better. I am also working on starting a distillery, [bicikyl](https://bicikyl.com/future), where we will distill vodkas and whiskeys. 

I speak English, but am in the process of learning Spanish and I have been to 22 different countries and 23 different US states.
