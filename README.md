Hey! My name is (An)drew, I'm from Ohio. 
I am working on random projects for now, nothing planned for now.

In my free time I love to go to the gym, travel and golf. My main form of employment is for a window cleaning company, I am trying to learn more about drones and rockets as of now. I am in the process of learning Spanish and a bit of German. I have been to 25 different countries and 25 different states. I love hiking and mountain scenery.
