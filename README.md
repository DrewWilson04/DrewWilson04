Hey! My name is (An)drew, im from Ohio. I am currently working on collecting weather data, by launching rockets with data collection devices installed, to help better understand the weather and to help better predict the weather. I am also in the process of starting a vodka and whiskey company, [bicikyl](https://bicikyl.com/future). I speak English, but am in the process of learning Spanish. I have been to 19 different countries and 23 different states.
