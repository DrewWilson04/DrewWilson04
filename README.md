Hey! My name is (An)drew, im from Ohio. I'm a window cleaner and am in school to become a carpenter. I like to code on the side as well. Some things about me are that I love the ocean and sports. 


I am currently working on [Cryzza](https://cryzza.com) which will make trading crypto cooler, more efficient, cost less, and safer.
